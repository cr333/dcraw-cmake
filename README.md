# dcraw-cmake
This is a GitHub mirror of [dcraw](https://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/) by Dave Coffin, the de-facto reference software for decoding almost any raw digital image format.

The **dcraw** branch contains the original, unmodified sources of `dcraw.c` as of obtained from [Dave Coffin](https://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/). When a new version comes out, this branch should be updated, and then merged into the 'master' branch.

The **master** branch contains a lightly modified version of dcraw with a few fixes for Microsoft Visual C++ (tested on version 2012), and a basic CMake file for building `dcraw`.
